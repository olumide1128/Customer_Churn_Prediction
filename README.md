# Customer Churn Prediction
For this project, I used the Random Forest Classifier to train a model to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving or staying with a Bank based on 10 independent features and 10000 records

# Instructions
- Clone this repo to a directory on your pc, in the root directory, open a cmd and type 'python main.py' to run the main file.
- You would be asked to provide some customer details to predict if the customer would leave the Bank or not.

# Customer Details
	creditScore (int)
	country (string)
	gender (string)
	age (int)
	tenure (int)
	balance (float)
	numProducts (int)
	hasCrCard (int) (1 for yes / 0 for no)
	isActive (int) (1 for yes / 0 for no): ")
	salary (float)
